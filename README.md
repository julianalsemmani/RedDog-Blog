# RedDog-Blog
RedDog Blog is a Blog System written with Vue.js and Java (Javalin Framework)

## This is just a project to become better at Java.

#### Currently this Blog System does not use any Database, or JSON for data. It's using a DataRepository to store information, which mean that Information will not be permanent. I want to complete the whole system (Logics, etc.) before I change it to function with a MYSQL Database.
